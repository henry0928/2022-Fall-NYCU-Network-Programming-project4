# 2022-Fall-NYCU-Network-Programming-project4

In this project, you are going to implement the SOCKS 4/4A protocol in the application layer of the
OSI model.
SOCKS is similar to a proxy (i.e., intermediary-program) that acts as both server and client for the purpose
of making requests on behalf of other clients. Because the SOCKS protocol is independent of application
protocols, it can be used for many different services: telnet, ftp, WWW, etc.
There are two types of the SOCKS operations, namely CONNECT and BIND. You have to implement
both of them in this project. We will use Boost.Asio library to accomplish this project.
